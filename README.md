# Crime Incident Report

This Crime Incident Report aims to identify the change in the number of crime reports that are filed within a city in response to a major type of regular entertainment occurring on that same day. In this case, I have chosen to analyze the number of crimes in Baltimore, Maryland before, during, and after a Baltimore Raven's Home Football Game in 2014.

I have calculated the total number of crimes per hour for the 2 hours before, during, and after the entertainment/control event and have filtered the crime data to only focus on the date and hours surrounding the chosen event. Hours were rounded to the nearest hour (i.e. 8:15pm was rounded to 8) and results were displayed by using necessary packages. The report concludes with the % changes in crime reports during the entertainment events and a comparison with the chosen control dates and times. A conclusion was made indicating the various change in crime rates as well as a take-away message and limitations of the study.

This report replicates Ryan Copus and Hannah Laqueur's study "Entertainment as Crime Prevention: Evidence From Chicago Sports Games 2014."
